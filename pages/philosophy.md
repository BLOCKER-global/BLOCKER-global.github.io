# Mission and Philosophy
To democratize the development of sustainable and scalable infrastructure and allow "common people" to build tangible holdings of human infrastructure.

## Sustainable
All BLOCKER provisionments are modular and reusable.  Your "laundromat, nightclub, spa, toast cafe combination" didn't work out?

The BLOCKER `engine` can determine a bounty on the nearest root ancestor of a `Blockerfile` which is being requested for somebody elses build and buy it back up.

````Docker
# BOCKERFILE

FROM empty_40
APPLY  wiring_16AWG
APPLY  https://github.com/synaesthesiaflow/blocker-mod__indestructible-rod.git

... Contents before this line ===> $$$ ... Other things no longer relevant ...

````

### Stakeholders: Anybody participating in the blocker ecosystem.

Anybody who contributes to the system has a stake. Design using a modular language for sustainability.
