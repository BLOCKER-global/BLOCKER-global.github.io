# Business Model

#### Commisions on Sales - payment taken to keep the `engine` running
The bottom line service that the BLOCKER `engine` provides a **massive improvement (10x) on logistics efficacy.**

BLOCKER will be disruptive in the infrastructure space in the same way that Uber or Lyft were in the rideshare space.
  
The profits there are passed down to the User categories -
Consumers (provisioners), and Contributors (craftspeople).

## User Stories

### Category A - The Consuming User: (analagous to a buyer on Amazon)
The user who provisions and ultimately purchases BLOCKs to be provisioned.
They build a library of their projects, and by virtue of buy in to the BLOCKER ecosystem.

Other perks: Telemetry.
You're only getting 1kW out of your 7kW solar system.  What could be the issue?  Similar telemetry throughout the blocker ecosystem can tell you if your equipment is up to snuff.. perhaps your Lead Acid battery `Mod` is simply old.

### Category B - The Contributor User:  (analagous to a seller on Amazon)
These will largely be makers and craftspeople.

For example you are a craftsperson who does carpentry work.  You have heard about the blocker marketplace.
You decide "BLOCKERize" your carpentry, which really just means conforming to certain mechanical, electrical specs such that your product can be installed in a contaner.
Your business / service is registered in with the `engine` API, and your `Mod` is added to the marketplace.  Now users can see your product and provision your product in their `solutions` (in `Builder` section of `BlockerHub`)

One week later you have containers arriving at the location of your choice, ready for you to install your Mod, and run any needed validation.  Once the orders are fulfilled you profit $$$.

Other perks:  Telemetry.
As a mod provider you may be entitled to anonymized telemetry data.
Received a support ticket because your BLOCKERized power system failed?  Check the associated telemetry.
Hmm.. there were mechanical shocks that happened on June 6th, 2020 at 06:34  Subsequently you can see that there is an anomalous power consumption signature (compared to similar BLOCKs).  This explains a lot!
