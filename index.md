# Welcome to the world of BLOCKER

Blocker is a port of Docker containerization practices from the software domain to that of physical infrastructure in shipping containers.

Infrastructure may be deployed, recalled, moved, and iterated upon with a high degree of agility.

## Moto
```angular2
INFRASTRUCTURE NOW.
```


## Executive Synopsis

If one were to describe the *Blocker Marketplace* in terms of existing products it would be:

    GitHub x Amazon
    
+ On the one hand it is a social platform for sharing implimentations (semantics) expressed through the BLOCKER language (syntax).
+ On the other hand it is a marketplace to bring the **NOW** to infrastructure, in the same way that amazon caters to "consumerism now"... logistics handled.  No need to wait.
